Text: In 2015, Vice UK gets in touch with us for the Chemsex movie visual identity, a hard-hitting documentary on drugs and sex social phenomenon in London gay community. The poster is in synch with the film structure and brings up the duality between vulnerable and intimate portraits of main characters and violence of their environment.
